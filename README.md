# Haiku You
ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸

Haiku You creates idiosyncratic techno poems out of random tweets given a Twitter user's public account!

Using regular expressions, syllables are parsed then joined to create the classic haiku 5-7-5 meter. The user can then edit their results and choose to send the poem to be tweeted at @haiku_you19.

The web app was built with React, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, and the Twitter API.

To run this app locally:

Clone or fork this repo.

Install create-react-app

`$ create-react-app -g`

In your new repo

`$ npm install`

And then 

`$ npm start`

Haiku You should now be running on port 3000!
